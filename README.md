# Analysis of Quebec Delta SARS-CoV-2 from White-Tailed Deer

This repo contains code used to generate the results and figures described in the "Characterizing Delta SARS-CoV-2 infection and host response in free-ranging white-tailed deer in southern Quebec, Canada" paper.

Not all data are included in this repo (size limits, licensing) and the intent is to document what analyses were performed rather than providing automatic reproduction of results and figures.

## `notebooks/`

This directory contains Bash, Python and R Jupyter Notebooks used for analyses performed on the reference mapped assemblies of the QC WTD SARS-CoV-2.

* R Jupyter Notebooks require the [IRkernel](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/)
* Bash Jupyter Notebooks require the [bash_kernel](https://pypi.org/project/bash_kernel/)

## `data/`

Contains data and output related to the analyses performed.

## `conda-envs/`

Contains YAML files describing Conda environments for analyses conducted in R and Python.
